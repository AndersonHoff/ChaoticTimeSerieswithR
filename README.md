# Chaotic Time Series with R

Routines to sistematically analyse chaotic time series of dynamic systems.

These simple routines were developed during my post-doctorate in Physics,
working in the Laboratory of Non-linear Circuits, at Santa Catarina State University. 

The packages used to systematicaly analyse the time series data, benerated by numerical and experimental methods, are listed below:

R package to perform the 0-1 Test for Chaos:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Chaos01/index.html

R package based on the well-known TISEAN Package:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tseriesChaos/index.html

The paper below is resulted from different analysis in a Watt Governor System, 
inncludind the 0-1 Test with the scrips cited.

"Characterizing the Dynamics of the Watt Governor System Under Harmonic Perturbation and Gaussian Noise"

This article is a Featured Article in International Journal of Bifurcation and 
Chaos, and also the cover of the journal.
